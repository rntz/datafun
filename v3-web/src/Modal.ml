(* A quick note about preorders; skip this if you know about them.
 *
 * A preorder is a relation (a ≤ b) satisfying two rules:
 * 1. Reflexivity: a ≤ a.
 * 2. Transitivity: if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c.
 *
 * A good example of a preorder is "lists under containment":
 * let (X ≤ Y) if every element of the list X is also in Y.
 *
 * Preorders are like partial orders, but without requiring antisymmetry.
 * Let a ≡ b iff a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a. Antisymmetry says: a ≡ b ⊃ a = b.
 * Under "list containment" [0,1] ≡ [1,0], even though [0,1] ≠ [1,0]
 *
 * If you're a category theorist, a preorder is a "thin" category, where between
 * any two objects there is at most one morphism. I believe much of the "tone
 * theory" in this file, ostensibly about maps between preorders, can be
 * extended to functors between categories.
 *)


(* ========== TONES ========== *)
(* Tones have two definitions:
 *
 * 1. Ways a function may respect the ordering on its argument.
 * 2. Transformations on the ordering of a preorder.
 *
 * Let's focus on the first definition for now.
 *)
type tone
  = Id    (* monotone:  x ≤ y           implies f(x) ≤ f(y) *)
  | Op    (* antitone:  x ≥ y           implies f(x) ≤ f(y) *)
  | Iso   (* invariant: (x ≤ y ∧ x ≥ y) implies f(x) ≤ f(y) *)
  | Path  (* bivariant: (x ≤ y ∨ x ≥ y) implies f(x) ≤ f(y) *)

(* Consider an arbitrary preorder A. Let A^op be A, ordered oppositely.
 * Now, observe that
 *
 *               (f : A -> B) is antitone
 *
 *                    if and only if
 *
 *              (f : A^op -> B) is monotone
 *
 * So "antitone" is a special case of "monotone"!
 *
 * This observation generalizes; every tone is really monotonicity with a
 * transformation applied to the domain's ordering. Tones transform orderings.
 *)

(* We formalize this as follows, letting A^s be "A transformed by the tone s":
 *
 *          (f : A -> B) respects its arguments with tone s
 *
 *                          if and only if
 *
 *          (f : A^s -> B) is a monotone map from A^s to B
 *
 * Of course, we still need to define A^s:
 * 
 * 1. id leaves the order unchanged.
 *
 * 2. op inverts it: (a ≤ b): A^op iff (b ≤ a): A.
 *
 * 3. iso gives the induced equivalence, the smallest preorder such that
 *    (a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a): A implies a ≤ b : A^iso.
 *
 * 4. path gives the equivalence closure, the smallest preorder such that
 *    (a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a): A implies a ≤ b : A^path.
 *)

(* Note that (a ≤ b): A^iso iff (a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a): A.
 *
 * A^path, the dual of A^iso, is not so easy to define directly. In particular,
 * (a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a): A implies, but isn't always implied by, (a ≤ b): A^path.
 * A good counterexample is the "fencepost ordering", Fencepost:
 *
 *       1   3   5   7   ...
 *      / \ / \ / \ / \ /
 *     0   2   4   6   8 ...
 *
 * That is, (x ≤ x+1 iff x even) and (x ≥ x+1 iff x odd).
 * In Fencepost^path, everything is equivalent:
 *
 *     0 ≡ 1 ≡ 2 ≡ 3 ≡ 4 ...
 *
 * But in Fencepost, (a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a) is equivalent to |a-b| ≤ 1, which isn't
 * even transitive!
 *)


(* ---------- TONE COMPOSITION ---------- *)
(* Tone composition, (s ** t), corresponds to two things:
 *
 * 1. Composing functions with the given tones.
 *    Given f : A^s -> B and g : B^t -> C, their composition
 *    (f then g), in general, has tone (s ** t).
 *
 * 2. Composing the preorder transformations, postfix:
 *    A^(s ** t) = (A^s)^t.
 *)
let ( ** ) (a: tone) (b: tone): tone = match a,b with
  | x, Id | Id, x -> x
  | Op, Op -> Id
  | Iso, _ | Path, _ -> a   (* hi priority, must come first *)
  | _, Iso | _, Path -> b   (* lo priority, comes later *)

(* Tone composition is associative, with Id as identity. Further laws:
 *
 *      Op ** Op  = Id
 *      Path ** s = Path
 *      Iso  ** s = Iso
 *
 * Tone composition is NOT commutative. For example,
 * Path = Path ** Iso ≠ Iso ** Path = Iso.
 *)


(* ---------- THE TONE LATTICE ---------- *)
(* Tones themselves have a natural ordering: let (s ≤ t) iff
 * (∀A. A^s is a subpreorder of A^t). This looks like:
 *
 *    Path              greatest
 *    / \
 *  Id   Op
 *    \ /
 *    Iso               least
 *
 *)
let subtone (a: tone) (b: tone): bool = match a,b with
  | Iso, _ | _, Path | Id, Id | Op, Op -> true
  | _, Iso | Path, _ | Op, Id | Id, Op -> false

(* "meet" means "greatest lower bound"; we'll need this for subtyping. *)
let meet2 (a: tone) (b: tone): tone = match a, b with
  | Iso, _ | _, Iso | Id, Op | Op, Id -> Iso
  | x, Path | Path, x -> x
  | Id, Id | Op, Op -> a

let meet: tone list -> tone = List.fold_left meet2 Path


(* ========== TYPES ========== *)
(* Here is a simple fragment of Modal Datafun's type system.
 *
 * You can think of it as a type system for a simply typed lambda calculus,
 * but one where types are interpreted as /preorders/, not sets; and where
 * all functions are monotone.
 *)
type tag = string
type tp =
  [ `Base                       (* some arbitrary type *)
  | `Fn of tp * tp              (* functions *)
  | `Tuple of tp list           (* tuples *)
  | `Sum of (tag * tp) list     (* sums *)
  | `Set of tp                  (* finite sets *)
  | `Box of tp                  (* internalizes Iso / the discrete ordering *)
  | `Op of tp ]                 (* internalizes Op / the opposite ordering *)

(* Internalizing Id is trivial; it's the identity function on types.
 * Internalizing Path is... nontrivial.
 * If you know what Path's intro/elim/subtyping rules should be, email me.
 *)

(* ---------- SUBTYPING ---------- *)

(* Write (A <: B) for "A is a subpreorder of B", by which I mean:
 * 1. A is a subset of B
 * 2. (x <= y at A) implies (x <= y at B).
 *
 * Since our types represent preorders, we'd like our subtyping relation to
 * match this. However, for type inference purposes, it's convenient if we solve
 * a more general problem, namely:
 *
 *     Given types A, B, what is the greatest tone s such that A^s <: B?
 *     Or does no such tone exist?
 *
 * And that's what I /hope/ this code does. I have sketched cases of a proof
 * that, if (s = subtype A B), then (A^s <: B). I also have, for many of my
 * subtyping rules, counterexamples that show that their conclusions can't be
 * safely strengthened. However, that's as far as I've gotten, proof-wise.
