# reverse mode incrementalization
- lenses?
- matthijs vakar & tom smeding: linearity & reverse mode
  linear things can be evaluated in reverse
  they generalize reverse mode to type-with-monoid?
  "reverse AD at higher types": https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05283
  or "dual-numbers reverse ad, efficiently"?

# switch to applicative syntax (not monadic) for relational algebra
can this make compiling to efficient joins easier?

# What else would I like to do?
- voice control intersect PL/tooling design?
- PL intersect DB/query languages, incrementalization
https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/
- how do you turn a language design into a library design?
