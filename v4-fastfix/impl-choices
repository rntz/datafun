- functions (non-eqtypes) inside sets? NO.

- sets inside sets?

- monadic comprehensions, or just applicative?

- (fix : (A -> A) -> A), allowing nested fixed points
  or (fix : box(A -> A) -> A), preventing nested fixed points

- support higher-order functions at runtime as closures
  or compile them away by defunctionalisation
  or compile them away by normalisation
     which requires queries have first-order inputs & output
