- make new rntz.cls that combines all appropriate features.
  - rntzfont
  - rntzgeometry
  - nccmath to fix align* spacing issues
  - microtype

- define \mathvar for multi-letter variables in rntzfont.sty. For Euler,
  \ensuremath. For newtxmath when text font and math font match exactly,
  \mathit. Problem: what about when using newmath with a font other than the one
  used? How does \mathit work, anyway?
