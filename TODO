- Find remaining places I use em rather than \baselineskip for vertical space
  measures. Use \baselineskip; em behaves unpredictably when scaling fonts.

- make new rntz.cls that combines all appropriate features.
  - rntzfont
  - rntzgeometry
  - nccmath to fix align* spacing issues
  - microtype

- style lists like so:
  \usepackage{enumitem}
  \setlist{labelindent=0em,labelsep=.75em,leftmargin=*}

- make rntzfont not fiddle with \linespread?

- define \mathvar for multi-letter variables in rntzfont.sty. For Euler,
  \ensuremath. For newtxmath when text font and math font match exactly,
  \mathit. Problem: what about when using newmath with a font other than the one
  used? How does \mathit work, anyway?
