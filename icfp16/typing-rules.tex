\section{Type System}
\label{sec:typing-rules}

Datafun's typing judgment $\J{\GD}{\GG}{e}{A}$ is defined by the inference rules
given in Figure \ref{fig:typing-rules}. We gloss $\J{\GD}{\GG}{e}{A}$ as
follows: ``expression $e$ has type $A$ using variables from $\GD \cup \GG$, and
moreover the value of $e$ is \emph{monotone} with respect to the variables in
$\GG$''.

The context $\GD$ types discrete variables; $\GG$, monotone variables. Both
admit the usual structural rules of exchange, weakening, and contraction.
Variables from either context may be used freely (rules \rt{var}, $\rt{var}^+$).

For clarity, we also give typing rules for our syntax sugar, in
Figure~\ref{fig:pattern-typing}. These use the auxilliary judgments
$\Jp{\GD}{\GG}{p}{A}{\GD'}$, which can be read as saying that ``in the contexts
$\GD$ and $\GG$, the pattern $p$ typechecks at type $A$, binding the variables
in $\GD'$''; and $\Jl{\GD}{\GG}{\mc{L}}{\GD'}$, which says that ``in the
contexts $\GD$ and $\GG$, the comprehension clauses in $\mc{L}$ bind the
variables in $\GD'$''.

\subsection{Functions and Application}
Two function types require two function introduction rules: the discrete
$\lambda$ and the monotone $\lambda^+$. These simply introduce variables into
their respective contexts. Monotone function application $\rt{app}^+$ is
perfectly standard, but discrete function application \rt{app} has a pecularity:
the argument $e_2$ gets an \emph{empty} monotone context.

To understand why, recall our gloss: the application $e_1\;e_2$ must be monotone
in $\GG$. But $e_1$ is a discrete, and in general \emph{non-monotone}, function
$A \uto B$: there is no guarantee that it respect any order on its argument.
(Suppose, for example, $e_2$ were some monotone variable $\m{x} : A \in \GG$.)
We work around this scoff-law behavior on $e_1$'s part by ensuring its argument
$e_2$ is \emph{constant} with respect to $\GG$---which we accomplish by simply
prohibiting $e_2$ from using any of $\GG$'s variables.

This technique of \emph{wiping clean} the monotone context to guarantee
constancy\footnote{Wherever we write ``constant'' in this section, substitute
  ``constant with respect to the monotone context''. The discrete context is
  never ``wiped clean'', and behaves entirely as it would in a simply-typed
  $\lambda$-calculus.} of a subterm recurs in several other rules. Readers
familiar with linear logic's $!$ comonad~\cite{linearlogic} or with judgmental
formulations of modal logics of necessity~\cite{jrml} may notice a feeling of
\textit{d\'ej\`a vu}; indeed, there is a hidden comonad at work here. But we are
getting ahead of ourselves. For more on that, turn to Section
\ref{sec:semantics}.

\subsection{Products and Sums}
The pairing and projection rules, \rt{pair} and $\pi$, are completely standard,
as is the \rt{in} rule for sum introduction. Sum elimination, however, splits
into two rules, \rt{case} and $\rt{case}^+$. $\rt{case}^+$ requires its branches
to be monotone in the variable $\m{x}$ it introduces, and consequently its
subject $e$ is permitted access to the monotone context $\GG$. \rt{case},
however, analyses its subject $e$ as a constant --- wiping clean its monotone
context --- and thus is allowed to introduce the variable $x$ into the discrete
context $\GD$.

\subsection{Booleans}
\label{sec:typing-rules-booleans}

While \rt{true} and \rt{false} are straightforward, there are two rules for
boolean elimination, \rt{if} and $\rt{if}^+$. This is because in Datafun, $1$
plus $1$ does not equal $\bool$: booleans are \emph{not} a sum of
units.\footnote{For simplicity, we have omitted the unit type 1 from our
  presentation of Datafun, but it is easy enough to imagine including it.} At
the type $1 + 1$, $\ms{in}_1 \triv$ and $\ms{in}_2 \triv$ are incomparable. But
in Datafun, $\ms{true} > \ms{false}$. Therefore, to eliminate a boolean in a
monotone fashion, one must ensure one's \emph{then}-branch is always greater
than one's \emph{else}-branch.

Thus Datafun has two \ms{if} rules. First, \rt{if}, where the boolean $e$ being
analysed is constant (has an empty monotone context), and so the branches $e_1$,
$e_2$ may be arbitrary expressions.

Second, $\rt{if}^+$, where the subject $e$ has full access to $\GG$, but the
\ms{if}-expression must have \emph{semilattice type}, and the \emph{else}-branch
is constrained to be $\unit$ --- the least value, thus smaller than $e_1$.

This is a conservative approach: there are many semantically monotone, but
untypeable, \ms{if}-terms. However, it is complete for semilattice types, for in
that case $(\ifthen{e}{e_1}{e_2})$ may be rewritten $(e_2 \vee
\ifthen{e}{e_1}{\unit})$; as long as $e_1 \ge e_2$ and so $e_2 \vee e_1 = e_1$,
this will not change the meaning of the expression, only (potentially) its
execution efficiency.

Thus the only meaningful restriction here is to semilattice types. In practice,
we have yet to find a case where this is problematic.

% \todo{Mention that $e_1 \ge e_2$ is in general statically undecidable (Rice's
%  theorem), and that a typesystem to check it would amount to dependent typing?}

\subsection{Semilattices and Sets}
The semilattice $\unit$ and $\vee$ operations are typed by the rules of the same
name. As $\vee$ is monotone, its arguments have full access to the monotone
context $\GG$.

Recall that sets are ordered by inclusion: although $2 \le 3$, nonetheless
$\singleset{2} \not\le \singleset{3}$. For this reason the rule $\{\}$ for
constructing a singleton set $\singleset{e}$ wipes clean its element $e$'s
monotone context. Datafun does not need empty-set or union operators, since
$\unit$ and $\vee$ generalize them.

Finally, we come to $\bigvee$, the set-comprehension rule. This rule has the
flavor of a monadic ``bind'' operation, but generalized to a result of any
semilattice type. This operation is naturally monotone both in the set $e_1$
being iterated over and in the expression $e_2$ which we are taking the least
upper bound of. Since sets are ordered by inclusion regardless of the ordering
on their elements, $e_2$ is not required to be monotone in the variable $x$.

%% \subsection{Maps}
%% Finite maps are an abstract type, and most of their interface is exposed through
%% primitive functions (see Figure \ref{fig:primitives}). The only typing rule is
%% $\{:\}$, the introduction rule for singleton maps. By analogy with the
%% introduction rule for singleton sets $\{\}$,

\subsection{Fixed Points}

The reason Datafun tracks monotonicity is to permit taking fixed-points of
monotone functions. \rt{fix} expresses exactly that. As mentioned in Section
\ref{sec:informally}, however, it is limited to types of the form $\fineq{L}$:
finite semilattice eqtypes.

$\rt{fix}_\le$ loosens this restriction by letting us take fixed points at
(not-necessarily-finite) semilattice eqtypes $\eq{L}$, as long as we provide an
upper bound $e_1 : \eq{L}$ which we can check we do not exceed.
