What fixed-point theorem do we need for (fix x <= e_top in e : L)?

Consider the sub-semilattice of L: {a | a <= e_top}. Call this P. Since L is
all-finite-height, P has finite height.

Let (f x = if e <= e_top then e else e_top).
Then f is a monotone map P -> P!

So by Theorem 1, f has a fixed point, and by theorem 3, we can find it by
iteration.

* Definitions
Definition: All-finite-height
A poset A is all-finite-height if every element x : A has finite height.

Definition: Height of an element of a poset
The height of an element x : A is the height of the subposet {y : A | y <= x}.

Definition: Height of a poset
The height of a poset is the cardinality of its largest chain.

Definition: chain of a poset
A chain is a totally ordered subset of a poset.

Definition: pointed poset
A poset is pointed iff it has a least element (written 0).

* 1. Fixed points on posets of finite height
Any monotone f : A -> A on a nonempty poset A of finite height has a fixed
point.

Proof: Consider a minimal element x : A. (To find minimal element, order all
elements by their height.) Consider the set:

    x, f(x), f^2(x), f^3(x), ...

Either:
- x = f(x), in which case we are done
- f(x) < x, which is impossible, since x is minimal
- or x < f(x).

Given x < f(x) and f monotone, we have f(x) < f^2(x), f^2(x) < f^3(x), etc. Thus
this sequence forms an ascending chain. A is finite-height, so all chains of A
are finite, so this chain must have a greatest element or supremum of the form
f^n(x) such that f^n(x) = f^{n+1}(x). QED.

* 2. Fixed points on all-finite-height pointed posets
For any monotone f : A -> A on an all-finite-height pointed poset A,if f has a
fixed point, it has a least fixed point of the form f^n(0).

Proof: From theorem 3, below.

* 3. Finite height fixed point implies least fixed point in pointed poset
For any pointed poset A and monotone f : A -> A, if f has a finite-height fixed
point, it has a least fixed point of the form f^n(0).

Proof: Consider the sequence S:

    0, f(0), f^2(0), f^3(0), ...

By the same argument as in Theorem 1, S is an ascending chain.

Consider any fixed point X of f. We have 0 <= X. Thus f(0) <= X, f^2(0) <= X,
etc. Thus S contains only elements <= X. Thus, any fixed point in S is smaller
than X.

Thus, if S contains a fixed point, it is a least fixed point.

Now, let X be a finite-height fixed point of f. (We know one exists by
assumption.) By the same argument, S contains only elements <= X. Thus S is a
chain of the poset {y : A | y <= X}. Thus S is finite (since X has finite
height). Thus it contains at least one fixed-point of f.

Thus, by previous argument, that fixed-point is a least fixed point.
