%% \paragraph{Finite and bounded fixed-points} \TODO Discuss
%% Datalog's constructor-free restriction, not being sure how to encode it in a
%% type theory, its disadvantages, and the disadvantages of our approaches ---
%% finite \& bounded fixed-points.

%% bounded fixed-points strictly more general than finitary-type fixed-points, but
%% at possible runtime cost, but finite types very restrictive in practice

%% \TODO In particular, could bounded fix-points have adverse performance
%% implications?
