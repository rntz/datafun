- make a Model type which captures what I need of a model for Datafun, then
  define semantics for any Model. This will make it clearer what I need to hold
  of change structures or similar.

- Get Changes* working again. I've switched to the pointwise definition of cat→,
  unintentionally, and now they don't type-check!

- Figure out whether Datafun-with-Trees (& its ProsetSem cousins) are useful or not.

- Figure out whether Precontexts is useful or not.

- WTF is going on with DepChanges, Changes{1,2,3}, and so forth?

- try replacing Contexts with Precontexts in Datafun, giving the ordering on
  modes. This should allow renaming to replace a monotone var with a discrete
  one.

- consider how to make product & sum objects produced in the types of holes look
  more reasonable. would going back to the old Product/Sum solve this? use "git
  checkout" to see!

- fix the precedences for ∨, ∧, ≤, ⊆, ∈, etc. Not so loose, and ∨ looser than ∧.

- stop using ∪ and use ∨ instead

- Figure out how I'll be handling ACC. ProsetSem.Types needs this.
  Answer: use "classical" definition of ACC & use Markov to do the fixed point
  computation. So do I use ClassicalAcc.agda and throw away ACC.agda?

- Lambdas.agda: Either work on it or put it in a different repo.
  Looks like there's an aborted attempt to use it in ProsetSem.Terms.
