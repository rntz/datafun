  -- This function will, in fact, terminate (assuming `terminates` has been
  -- proven legitimately), but Agda's termination checker won't accept it;
  -- Markov's principle is not provable constructively.
  --
  -- NON_TERMINATING makes Agda accept the definition anyway. However, Agda
  -- won't try to reduce it during typechecking, which is probably for the best.
  -- We could also mark it TERMINATING, in which case Agda *would* try to reduce
  -- it during typechecking.
