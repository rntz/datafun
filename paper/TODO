* Immediate future work
- Operational semantics & adequacy theorem
- Implement polymorphism a la Dunfield + Neel
- Finally kill off s-expression syntax

* Goals for final version
- rename "ordinary" to "discrete"

- Situate Datafun better wrt other database languages (besides Datalog)
  Rel.Alg., SQL, Nested Relational Calculus, Kleisli, Machiavelli

- Situate Datafun better wrt other logic languages
  Curry, Mercury

- Get "contributions" onto the first page - should be accessible "at a glance".
  Shorten or split up introduction?

* To-dos
- appendix with proofs!
- implementation: either more info, or reformat type inference para.
- Semantics: explain diagram, comonads & monads
- can we integrate "Comparing Datalog & Datafun" into another section?
- future work: types for enforcing datalog's constructor restriction?

** Nice-to-haves
- SQL (vs Datalog) vs Datafun example?
- Explanation of relation to adjoint logic
- An example that uses the Flat lattice?
- More related/future work:
  - LVARs
  - dataflow / propagators
  - transitive closures via matrix math
  - adjoint version which decomposes Set into Sups(Disc(P))
  - Bloom/L?
  - on-line monotone computation ("increasing over time" functor/monad)

* OLD STUFF
** Semantics

  - two level
    - Set/Poset adjunction
    - use this to explain the D(A <+> B) ~= D(A) + D(B) iso gives
      rise to 2 case rules
    - explain "ordinary" P => Q via "monotone" D(U(P)) -> Q
    - fixed points - we need finite equality lattices to ensure
      termination

** Examples
  o Graph reachability/ancestry as running example
  o SQL-style examples:
    - do some fairly hair concrete SQL thing?
      some business entity modeling thing?
      departments and engineers?
      (PROBLEM: no aggregation!)
    - joining two relations together (relation composition)
    - translating relational algebra to datafun?
  o Chart/CYK parsing
    - good example for bounded fix-points
  o Dataflow analysis
    - Liveness analysis? for while-language
  o Infinitary types?
    - ie, no infinite descending chains, but may nonterminate
      (lattice with top element)

** Comparisons, tradeoffs & limitations
*** general tradeoffs & design decisions
- we don't allow general recursion, even in functions. could easily lift this
  restriction, at cost of guaranteed termination.

- user can't define their own semilattice types w/ their own lub operator. we
  could *probably* allow this, as long as user is OK with unusual behavior if
  their operator isn't *actually* a semilattice. or, we could add a "hom"
  operator, like Machiavelli, which isn't optimizable, but allows application of
  non-semilattice fns to a set.

- we don't allow side-effects. if we DID, optimizing w/o changing behavior gets
  wicked hard. we could isolate side-effects with a monad, though (wink wink).

- we allow sets of non-equality types, which have no efficient deduplication
  strategy. only a problem if you use them. not hard to restrict if you want.

*** vs datalog
- we don't enforce constructor restriction.
  PRO: can call functional code from sets-code nicely
  CON: termination gets hairy (choose 1: finite types, bounded fixpoint, or possible nontermination)

- we are functional!
  PRO: we have datatypes!
  PRO: we have functions!
  PRO: sets are just another type!
  CON: optimization gets harder. how much harder? FUTURE WORK!

*** vs SQL
PRO: we are heaps more expressive, mostly
CON: optimization??? FUTURE WORK
CON: no (non-semilattice) aggregates yet (counting, summing, etc.)
     commutative monoids approach might fix this.
     or just a Machiavelli-style hom() approach. maybe add that?
CON: no persistence story (don't replace your databases just yet, folks)

** Future work

- optimization
  * datalog literature (magic sets?)
  * SQL literature
  * dataflow literature? kmett's propagators?
  * that paper about computing transitive closures via matrix math?!

- enforcing datalog "constructor restriction" / "parametricity" at type level:
  can it be encoded as (∀(a ≥ A) Set a →⁺ Set a)?

- polymorphism: it's nice to have!

- semantics for nonterminating version

- decomposing Set into Sups and Disc.

- a commutative monoid layer, for big data stuff? (Budiu & Plotkin)
  a monoid layer, because lists are important?

- connection to LVars?
- connection to CRDTs? eventual consistency?
- connection to Bloom?!

- does this + SAC/incremental computation = database views? does indexing figure
  in somehow?

- (distributed?) FRP with "increasing over time" type, ↑A. ↑ is a functor on
  Poset!
