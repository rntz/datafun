\section{Types and Semantics}
\label{sec:typing-and-semantics}

%In this section, we give the typing and semantics of core Datafun.
\input{fig-typing}

The syntax of core Datafun is given in \cref{fig:syntax} and its typing rules in
\cref{fig:core-datafun}. Contexts are lists of hypotheses $H$; a hypothesis
gives the type of either a monotone variable $\h x A$ or a discrete variable
$\hd x A$. The stripping operation $\stripcx\G$ drops all monotone hypotheses
from the context $\G$, leaving only the discrete ones.
%
The typing judgement $\J{e}{\G}{A}$ may be read as ``under hypotheses $\G$,
the term $e$ has type $A$''.

The \rn{var} and \rn{dvar} rules say that both monotone hypotheses $\h x A$ and
discrete hypotheses $\hd x A$ justify ascribing the variable $x$ the type $A$.
%
The \rn{lam} rule is the familiar rule for $\fn$-abstraction. However, note that
we introduce the argument variable $\h x A$ as a \emph{monotone} hypothesis, not
a discrete one. (This is the ``right'' choice because in \Poset\ the exponential
object is the poset of monotone functions.)
%
The application rule \rn{app} is standard, as are the rules \rn{unit},
\rn{pair}, \rn{prj}, \rn{inj}, and \rn{case}. As with \rn{lam}, the variables
$\h {x_i}{A_i}$ bound in the case branches $f_i$ are monotone.

\rn{box} says that $\ebox{e}$ has type $\iso A$ when $e$ has type $A$ in the
stripped context $\stripcx\G$. This restricts $e$ to refer only to discrete
variables, ensuring we don't smuggle any information we must treat monotonically
into a discretely-ordered $\iso$ expression. The elimination rule \rn{letbox}
for $(\eletbox x e f)$ allows us to ``cash in'' a boxed expression $e : \iso A$
by binding its result to a discrete variable $\hd x A$ in the body $f$.

At this point, our typing rules correspond to standard constructive S4 modal
logic~\cite{jrml}. We get to Datafun by adding a handful of domain-specific
types and operations.
%
First, \rn{split} provides an operator $\prim{split} : \iso(A + B) \to \iso A +
\iso B$ to distribute box across sum types.\footnote{An alternative syntax,
  pursued in \citet{datafun}, would be to give two rules for $\kw{case}$,
  depending on whether or not the scrutinee could be typechecked in a stripped
  context.}
%
The other direction, $\iso A + \iso B \to \iso (A + B)$, is already derivable,
as is the isomorphism $\iso A \times \iso B \cong \iso (A \times B)$.
%
This is used implicitly by box pattern-matching -- e.g., in the pattern $\pboxtuple{\inj 1 \dvar x, \inj 2 \dvar y}$, the variables $\dvar x$ and $\dvar y$ are both discrete, which is information we propagate via these conversions.
%
%% These conversions are used implicitly in pattern-matching to propagate
%% discreteness onto variables bound inside box patterns -- e.g, in the pattern
%% $\pboxtuple{\inj 1 \dvar x, \inj 2 \dvar y}$.
%
%% TODO: an example of desugaring pattern-matching here?
%
Semantically, all of these operations are the identity, as we
shall see shortly.


This leaves only the rules for manipulating sets and other semilattices.
\rn{bot} and \rn{join} tell us that $\bot$ and $\vee$ are valid at any
semilattice type $L$, that is, at sets and products of semilattice types.
%
The rule for set-elimination, \rn{for}, is \emph{almost} monadic bind.
%
However, we generalize it by allowing $\efor{x}{e}{f}$ to eliminate into any
semilattice type, not just sets, denoting a ``big semilattice join'' rather than
a ``big union''.
%
Finally, the introduction rule \rn{set} is says that $\esetsub{e_i}{i\in I}$ has
type $\tseteq A$ when each of the $\eisiso{e_i}$ has type $\eqt A$.
%
Just as in \rn{box}, each $\eisiso{e_i}$ has to typecheck in a stripped context;
constructing a set is a discrete operation, since $1 \le 2$ but $\esetraw{1}
\not\subseteq \esetraw{2}$.

Likewise discrete is equality comparison $\eeq{e_1}{e_2}$, whose rule \rn{eq} is
otherwise straightforward; and \rn{empty?}, which requires more explanation. The
idea is that $\eisempty e$ determines whether $e : \tset{\tunit}$ is empty,
returning $\inj 1 \etuple{}$ if it is, and $\inj 2 \etuple{}$ if it isn't. This
lets us turn ``booleans'' (sets of units) into values we can \kw{case}-analyse.
This is, however, not monotone, because while booleans are ordered $\efalse <
\etrue$, sum types are ordered disjointly; $\inj 1 ()$ and $\inj 2 ()$ are
simply incomparable.

Finally, the rule \rn{fix} for fixed points $\efix e$ takes a function $e : \isofixLtoL$ and yields an expression of type $\fixtLkern$.
%
The restriction to ``fixtypes'' ensures $\fixt L$ has no infinite ascending chains, guaranteeing the recursion will terminate.


\subsection{Semantics}\label{sec:semantics}

The syntax of core Datafun can be interpreted in $\Poset$, the category of
partially ordered sets and monotone maps. That is, an object of $\Poset$ is a
pair $(A, \leq_A)$ consisting of a set $A$ and a reflexive, transitive,
antisymmetric relation $\leq_A \subseteq A \times A$, while a morphism $f : A
\to B$ is a function such that $x \leq_A y \implies f(a) \leq_B f(b)$.

\subsubsection{Bicartesian Structure}

The bicartesian closed structure of $\Poset$ is largely the same as in $\Set$.
%
The product and sum sets are constructed the same way, and ordered pointwise:

\begin{align*}
  (a,b) \le_{A \x B} (a',b') &\iff a \le_A a \wedge b \le_B b'\\
  \inj i x \le_{A_1 + A_2} \inj j y &\iff i = j \wedge x \le_{A_i} y
\end{align*}

\noindent Projections $\pi_i$, injections $\injc_i$, tupling $\fork{f,g}$ and
case-analysis $\krof{f,g}$ are all the same as in \Set, pausing only to note
that all these operations preserve monotonicity, as we need.

The exponential $\expO A B$ consists of only the \emph{monotone} maps $f : A \to
B$, again ordered pointwise:

\[ f \le_{\expO A B} g \iff \fa{x \le_A y} f\<x \le_B g\<y \]

\noindent
Currying $\fn$ and evaluation are the same as in \Set. Supposing $f : A \x B \to
C$, then:

\begin{align*}
  \fn(f) &\isa A \to (\expO B C) &
  \eval_{A,B} &\isa (\expO A B) \x A \to B
  \\
  \fn(f) &= x \mapsto y \mapsto f(x,y) &
  \eval_{A,B} &= (g,x) \mapsto g(x)
\end{align*}

\noindent
Monotonicity here follows from the monotonicity of $f$ and $g$ and the pointwise ordering of $\expO A B$.


\subsubsection{The Discreteness Comonad}

Given a poset $(A, \leq_A)$ we define the discreteness comonad $\iso(A, \leq_A)$
as $(A, \leq_{\iso A})$, where \( a \leq_{\iso A} a' \iff a = a' \).
%
That is, the discrete order preserves the underlying elements, but reduces the
partial order to mere equality.
%
This forms a rather boring comonad whose functorial action $\iso(f)$, extraction $\varepsilon_A : \iso A \to A$, and duplication $\delta_A : \iso A \to \iso \iso A$ are all identities on the underlying sets:

\nopagebreak[2]
\begin{align*}
  \iso(f) &= f & \varepsilon_A &= a \mapsto a & \delta_A &= a \mapsto a
\end{align*}

\noindent
This makes the functor and comonad laws trivial. Monotonicity holds in each case because \emph{all} functions are monotone with respect to $\le_{\iso A}$.
%
It is also immediate that $\iso$ is monoidal with respect to \emph{both}
products and coproducts. That is, $\iso (A \times B) \cong \iso A \times \iso B$
and $\iso (A + B) \cong \iso A + \iso B$.
%
In both cases the isomorphism is witnessed by identity on the underlying
elements.
%
These lift to $n$-ary products and sums as well, which we write as $\isox : \prod_i \iso A_i \to \iso\prod_i A_i$ and $\isosum : \iso \sum_i
A_i \to \sum_i \iso A_i$.
%% %
%% We will write $\isox : \prod_i \iso A_i \to \iso\prod_i A_i$ to name the map
%% witnessing distributivity of products over $\iso$, and $\isosum : \iso \sum_i
%% A_i \to \sum_i \iso A_i$ to name the map witnessing distributivity of $\iso$
%% over coproducts.


\subsubsection{Sets and Semilattices}

Given a poset $(A, \leq_A)$ we define the finite powerset poset $\pfinof(A,
\leq_A)$ as $(P_{\mathrm{fin}}\, A, \subseteq)$, with finite subsets of $A$ as
elements, ordered by subset inclusion.
%
Note that the subset ordering completely ignores the element ordering $\leq_A$.
%
Finite sets admit a pair of useful morphisms:

\begin{align*}
  \morph{singleton} &\isa \iso A \to \pfinof A
  &
  \morph{isEmpty} &\isa \iso \pfinof A \to \termO + \termO
  \\
  \morph{singleton} &= a \mapsto \{a\}
  &
  \morph{isEmpty} &= X \mapsto 
  \begin{cases}
    \inj 1 () &\text{when }X = \emptyset\\
    \inj 2 () &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

\noindent
The \morph{singleton} function takes a value and makes a singleton set out of
it. The domain must be discrete, as otherwise the map will not be monotone (sets
are ordered by inclusion, and set membership relies on equality, not the partial
order). Similarly, the emptiness test \morph{isEmpty} also takes a discrete
set-valued argument, because otherwise the boolean test would not be monotone.

Sets also form a semilattice, with the least element given by the empty set, and
join given by union.
%
For this and other semilattices $L \in \Poset$, in particular products of
semilattices, we will write $\morph{join}^L_n : L^n \to L$ to denote the $n$-ary
semilattice join (least upper bound).
%
Also, if $f : A \times \iso B \to L$, we can define a morphism
$\pcollect{f} : A \times \pfinof{B} \to L$ as follows:

\begin{displaymath}
 \pcollect{f}  = (a, X) \mapsto \bigvee_{b \in X} f(a, b)
\end{displaymath}

\noindent
We will use this to interpret \kw{for}-loops. However, it is worth noting that
the discreteness restrictions on \morph{singleton} mean that finite sets do
not quite form a monad in $\Poset$.


\subsubsection{Equality} Every object $A \in \Poset$ admits an equality-test morphism \morph{eq}:

\begin{align*}
  \morph{eq} &\isa \iso A \x \iso A \to \pfinof{\termO}\\
  \morph{eq} &= (x,y) \mapsto 
  \begin{cases}
    \{()\} &\text{if }x = y\\
    \emptyset &\text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}

\noindent
The domain must be discrete, since $x = y$ and $y \le z$ certainly doesn't imply $x = z$.


\subsubsection{Fixed Points}

Given a semilattice $L \in \Poset$ without infinite ascending chains, we can
define a fixed point operation $\prim{fix} : (L \to L) \to L$ as follows:

\begin{displaymath}
  \efix{} = f \mapsto \bigvee_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f^n(\bot)
\end{displaymath}

\noindent
A routine inductive argument shows this must yield a least fixed point.


\input{fig-semantics}

\subsubsection{Interpretation} The semantic interpetation (defined
over typing derivations) is given in \cref{fig:semantics}.
%
The interpretation itself mostly follows the usual interpretation for
constructive S4~\cite{depaiva-s4}, with what novelty there is occuring in the
interpretation of sets and fixed points.
%
Even there, the semantics is straightforward, making fairly direct use of the
combinators defined above.
%
We give the interpretation in combinatory style, and to increase readability, we
freely use $n$-ary products to elide the book-keeping associated with
reassociating binary products.

Regarding notation, we write composition in diagrammatic or ``pipeline'' order with a simple centered dot, letting $f \cdot g : A \to C$ mean $f : A \to B$ followed by $g : B \to C$.
%
If $f_i : A \to B_i$ then we write $\fork{f_i}_i : A \to \prod_i B_i$ for the
``tupling map'' such that $\fork{f_i}_i \then \pi_j = f_j$.
%
In particular, $\fork{}$ is the map into the terminal object.
%
Dually, if $g_i : A_i \to B$ then we write $\krof{g_i}_i : \sum_i A_i
\to B$ for the ``case-analysis map'' such that $\injc_j \then \krof{g_i}_i =
g_j$.


\subsection{Metatheory}
\label{sec:weakening}

If we were presenting core Datafun in isolation, the usual thing to do would be
to prove the soundness of syntactic substitution, show that syntactic and
semantic substitution agree, and then establish the equational theory. However,
that is not our goal in this paper. We want to prove the correctness of the
semi\naive\ translation, which we will do with a logical relations argument.
Since we can harvest almost all the properties we need from the logical
relation, only a small residue of metatheory needs to be established manually --
indeed, the only thing we need to prove at this stage is the type-correctness of
weakening, which we will need to show the type-correctness of the
semi\naive\ transformation.

We define the weakening relation $\Gamma \sqsubseteq \Delta$ in
\cref{fig:weakening}. This says that $\Delta$ is a weakening of $\Gamma$, either
because it has extra hypotheses (\rn{drop}), or because a hypothesis in $\Gamma$
becomes discrete in $\Delta$ (\rn{disc}). The idea is that making a hypothesis
discrete only increases the number of places it can be used.

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:weaken}
  If\/ $\J e \G A$ and $\G \sqsubseteq \D$ then $\J e \D A$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent This follows by the usual induction on typing derivations.
