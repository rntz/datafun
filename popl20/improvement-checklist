1. TeX up the proof of correctness. (Also weakening & type-correctness.)

2. Try other formulations for logical relation, eg. a speeds-up and a changes
relation.

3. Instead of fastfix(f,f'), use fastfix(dx_0, f') where dx_0 = f ⊥. This does
   more work/optimisation at compile-time. Change the compiler first.

4. Prove substitution lemma.

5. Use two case rules (discrete/monotone) instead of a split axiom?
   Might be easier to understand.
