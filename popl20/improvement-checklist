1. Check formatting code examples in section 2. Avoid use of \isocolor in code
   examples - but what about for discrete variables?

2. Check spacing around align* environments, lists, figures, etc.
   Try adjusting \listisep.
   Check inter-figure and figure-text spacing.

3. Check for awkward line breaks, eg. before align* environments etc.

4. Check we compare with incremental & cache-passing-incremental in sec 7.

5. Do we introduce "boxing"/"unboxing" terminology somewhere? Probably section 2
   or section 4 is a good place.

6. Consider arraycolsep in fig-syntax, fig-typing. Grep for uses of
   begin{array}.

---------- POST SUBMISSION
1. TeX up the proof of correctness. (Also weakening & type-correctness.)

2. Try other formulations for logical relation, eg. a speeds-up and a changes
relation.

3. Instead of fastfix(f,f'), use fastfix(dx_0, f') where dx_0 = f ⊥. This does
   more work/optimisation at compile-time. Change the compiler first.

4. Prove substitution lemma.

5. Use two case rules (discrete/monotone) instead of a split axiom?
   Might be easier to understand.

6. Improve the flow of §5.1, in particular, the explanation of which variables
φe and δe have in context. The explanation of φe having zero change variables
doesn't come until too late.
