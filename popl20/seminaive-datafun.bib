  abstractNote={We consider logic programs with a single recursive rules, whose right-hand side consists of binary relations forming a chain. We give a complete characterization of all programs of this form that are computable in NC (assuming that P ≠ NC). Our proof uses ideas from automata and language theory, and the combinatorics of strings.},

   volume={33},
   ISSN={0360-0300},
   DOI={10.1145/502807.502810},
   abstractNote={This article surveys various complexity and expressiveness results on different forms of logic programming. The main focus is on decidable forms of logic programming, in particular, propositional logic programming and datalog, but we also mention general logic programming with function symbols. Next to classical results on plain logic programming (pure Horn clause programs), more recent results on various important extensions of logic programming are surveyed. These include logic programming with different forms of negation, disjunctive logic programming, logic programming with equality, and constraint logic programming.},
