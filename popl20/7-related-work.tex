\todo{Discuss possibility of allowing nested fixed points by removing the $\iso$
  from $\prim{fix}$'s argument. The problem here is $\delta(\efix f)$. I've
  previously worked out what this should be (cite that 3-page proof on my
  website): $\delta(\efix f) = \efix(\delta f \<(\efix f))$. But if we want to
  compute \emph{this} fixed point faster, we need a \emph{second derivative}. So
  if your program has $n$ nested fixed points, you probably need
  $n$\textsuperscript{th} derivatives. Future work!}
