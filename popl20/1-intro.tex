\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\paragraph{Contributions} Our main contribution is
extending Datalog's semi\naive\ evaluation into a program transformation which
works on higher-order programs.

\begin{itemize}
\item \XXX

%% \item We define a program transformation to statically convert well-typed
%%   Datafun programs (including ones that use higher-order functions) into an
%%   incrementalized version. We then use a logical relation to show that our
%%   incrementalization is correct, and so can be used to optimize Datafun
%%   programs.

%% \item We also implement our program transformation in a small compiler, and use
%%   this to show that we can automatically compile Datafun terms into optimized
%%   Haskell programs with the expected operational behaviour.

\end{itemize}
